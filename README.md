# A File-based Blog

This is a blog engine that uses normal files as the storage for the pages that are built dynamically using Handlebars templates.

Currently, the code base only represents the shell of an application. Your task is to complete the application. This will require you to:

* Define and complete the routes
* Create the Handlebars templates
* Write the data module that reads/saves to/from the file

## Instructions

1. Clone the repo
2. Create a branch for your team
3. Show the titles of blog entries on the home page
4. Link the titles to a page specific to a single entry
5. Create a page that let's you add a new entry

Enjoy yourself and get help when you need it.
